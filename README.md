# Linux

The reason for this repository is to help auto set up some Linux distrobutions in one go, so you do not need to monitory your new set up and just let the software you want to install.


## Where to Start?
If you are new to Linux I would recomend starting with Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition, this Linux distrobution is a good place to start when switching from Windows to Linux.  Linux Mint desktop enviroment is simular enough to Windows that you will not feel overwhemed to fast and be able to explore your new system with some comfort.

### Goals
Be able to run get-distro-type.sh and have the version of Linux you are running and offer to install software for your system automatically, completly hands off.  So when you retrun to your desktop you have a completly set up desktop ready to go.
