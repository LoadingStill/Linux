# Linux

The reason for this repository is to help auto set up some Linux distrobutions in one go, so you do not need to monitory your new set up and just let the software you want to install.




## Where to Start?
If you are new to Linux, I would recommend starting with Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition, this Linux distribution is a good place to start when switching from Windows to Linux.

### Recommended Linux Distro For People New To Linux
Linux Mint desktop environment is similar enough to Windows that you will not feel overwhelmed too fast and be able to explore your new system with some comfort.

### How To Use This Auto-Installing Scripts
1 When you have installed the Linux Distro of choice you will then need to navigate to https://github.com/LoadingStill/Linux
2 Click the Green Button near the top right of the repository section and select "Download Zip"

### Goals
Be able to run get-distro-type.sh and have the version of Linux you are running and offer to install software for your system automatically, completely hands off.  So when you return to your desktop you have a completely set up desktop ready to go.
